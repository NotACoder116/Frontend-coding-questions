-- Write a polyfill for promise all.
-- Implement setTimeout.
-- Implement memoize.
-- Polyfill of a bind?Polyfill of call?
-- Find contiguous subarray with given sum.
-- Given an array of api's, make api calls synchronously one after another each. Once all completed, execute a callback. Similar to Promise.all but just that all promises has to be resolved synchronously.
-- non repeated element in a sorted array.
-- Find three largest numbers in an array
-- There is a sorted integer array containing +ve and -ve numbers, you need to store the square of numbers in a sorted way
-- Find 3 largest numbers from an array without using any external data structure.
-- Merge two sorted array,
-- How javascript works, like the execution context and other theoretical questions like how async is handled and executed. Question about es6 array methods were also there.
-- one was to reverse a given string and another was to return odd and even sum from a given array.
-- Finding number in an array which is repeated twice and the number which is missing. All numbers are in range of 1 to n, and array has n elements.
-- Median of streaming numbers.
-- Find frequency of elements in an array in n time and 1 space

-- They asked me to write a code for searching in a rotated sorted array.
-- Find the number of jumps in array?
-- Create a subarray from an array based on the given sum value?
-- JS, OOJS, Functional concepts like compose, Pub Sub pattern, React, Timer and promise related coding
-- Binary Sort Logic.
-- Sorting Logic.
-- Bubble sort.
1. Given an unsorted array find the mindiff in k elements
* A = {1,3,5,7,11, 12, 13}, n=7 k=3
* {1,3,5} diff(5,1) = 4
* {11,12,13} diff(11,13) = 2

op : 2

2. we are given an unsorted array size = n all elements>0
find : total no of elements for which
there should be atleast 1 number which is smaller on left and right side

-- Fibanocci Series
-- DBMS ACID properties


Check if a given array is monotonous?
Find kth largest in a BST?




- Smallest subarray with sum greater than a given value
- Median in a stream of integers (running integers)
- Find the smallest positive number missing from an unsorted array

1. clone a linked list with next and random pointer.
2. one question based on tree. (it was a easy binary tree question)
- Design stack overflow (db entities)
